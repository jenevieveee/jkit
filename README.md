# J-Kit
## Jennie's XKit-like replacement for BDSMLR

X-Kit was great for tumblr. X-Kit was missing from BDSMLR.

Now we have the J-Kit project. The aim is not a replacement-in-kind for X-Kit, but to create the features that BDSMLR needs.

Right now, it's only published in source form for testing. Once the basic product is complete, a signed xpi will go up for Firefox.

## Modules 
There are several different modules and categories of enhancements. Ones marked **Complete** are functional; otherwise that module is just planned for a future release. 

#### Utility Add-ons

##### Boss Mode 
Hides the bdsmlr after 10 minutes (default) of inactivity. **Complete**

##### Dash Tweaks
Various tweaks to make the usability a bit better.  **Complete**, but never finished.

Within the Dash Tweaks module are also various 'fixes' for bdsmlr. The fixes by nature are transient, and in response to something on the site being broken. The fixes make things better, until the real (server-side) fix comes in, then they make things worse. If something seems wrong, try disabling the fixes.

##### Tag bundles
User-configurable "bundles" of tags to add to posts. Next major module. Completion of this one will trigger the xpi release.

##### Photoset Navigation
Allow arrow navigation of the images in a photoset, instead of having to open and close each one. *wishlist*

#### Skins
##### Metal
Metalic-inspired skin for the dash. **Complete**
##### Princess
Princess-inspired skin for the dash. *planned*

#### Kink Add-ons

##### Hypo Goonette
Explicit periodic reminders of why you girls are here. **Complete**

##### Hypo Sissy
Explicit periodic reminders of why you sissies are here. **Complete**

##### Expose Me
Takes pictures via webcam at random intervals and posts them. Dangerous. For true fans of the exposure kink only. *wishlist*

Because of the nature of this plug-in, it will require both one-time enabling via the option menu, and a per-session enabling.

#### Funny
##### Cum Bucket
Covers your screen in cum.  **Complete.**

#### Future
* non-deletable captions
* mute button
* Add block button to hover
* Dark mode skin
* Any other ideas?

## Name
J-Kit is Jennie's kit. You know me from BDSMLR and the BDSMLR Zendesk forums. Yes, I'm vain like that.

## Ad block
I can write an ad-blocker for bdsmlr and incorporate it into the add-on (like XKit's anti-capitalism module), but I'm not going to. Don't ask.  If you don't like the ads, see [https://bdsmlr.com/subscriptions](BDSMLR Subscriptions). 

**IF** I can figure out how the site tells subscribed users from non-subscribed users on the front-end (I haven't looked too hard), I will try to add one to block the once-daily and archives pop-ups. Because they shouldn't be there in the first place if you are a subscribed user.

## Contribute
### Ideas and requests
If you have an idea or request, please feel free to submit it via the issues tab. Please keep in mind that any ideas must be client-side (in other words, only within your browser or how it interacts with BDSMLR); I cannot control what the server does.

### Code
If you want to write a module, I welcome any contributions.

### Chrome
I have not tested on Chrome. Per the docs, the browser.extension.getURL() method works differently. This may break functionality, but it may just work, particularly with the skins and the tweaks. My priority is Firefox/moz first. Once I'm satisfied with the add-on, I'll look into making it work with Chrome/webkit. If someone else wants to do that first, I'd be more than happy to merge it in.
