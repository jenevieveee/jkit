# Installing

Because JKit is still alpha-level software, installing must be done via advanced configuration.

To install in firefox:

* Download the source from github. Github provides an option to download all source as a zip file, or you can clone the repository.
* Unzip the files to a convenient location on your computer, if you downloaded the zip file.
* Open Firefox.
* Go to about:debugging
* Click "This Firefox" on the left side column.
* Click "Load Temporary Add-on" on the upper right.
* Navigate to the folder where the source was unzipped or cloned.
* Select and open the manifest.json file.

That should load the add-on.

* Now, go to about:addons. 
* Click "Extensions" in the left column. The JKit add-on should appear in your list of extensions.
* Click on the JKit extension. This will open information about JKit
* Click "Preferences". This will open the JKit util options.
* Set the options you wish to enable. For first-time use, I recommend turning on the Boss screen, and all tweaks/fixes. The other modules are more specific to your individual tastes.

Open BDSMLR or refresh your tab, and enjoy. Some options will take effect immediately, others require a refresh.

Keep in mind this is a temporary add-on in alpha development. Settings will not be saved when you close Firefox. Once a signed xpi is created, you can permanently add the extension, and keep your settings.
